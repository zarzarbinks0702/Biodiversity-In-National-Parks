# Biodiversity-In-National-Parks
Interpreting data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.  Performing some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigating if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. Involves analyzing, cleaning, and plotting data as well as posing questions and answering them in a meaningful way. 



Conclusions

-How many species from each category are considered endangered?

Of the species observed in all the parks, 4 amphibian species, 16 bird species, 12 fish species, 44 mammal species, and 4 vascular plant species are considered endangered. None of the observed reptile or non-vascular plant species are considered endangered. Looking at the pie charts comparing the number of non-endangered species to endangered species, mammals are the category of species that have the most endangered species, both in pure numbers and percentage.

-What is the most common species from each sub-category of plant/animal?

The most common amphibian is the American Bullfrog, spotted 1097 times across the four parks. The most common bird is the Rock Dove, spotted 1653 times across the four parks. The most common fish is the Brook Trout, spotted 1270 times across the four parks. The most common mammal is the American Beaver, spotted 1725 times across the four parks. The most common non-vascular plant is the Ulota Moss, spotted 679 times across the four parks. The most common reptile is the Rubber Boa, spotted 1144 times across the four parks. The most common vascular plant is the Common Velvet Grass, spoetted 1780 times across the four parks. Of these species, the Common Velvet Grass was spotted the most often, making it the most spotted species overall.

-Which park has the most unique species?

Bryce National Park had the most unique species. While all the parks were very close in numbers, Bryce had the most vascular plant species and was tied for the most bird and mammal species. THe four parks looked at were scattered across the United States, so location isn't a factor in species diversity.
